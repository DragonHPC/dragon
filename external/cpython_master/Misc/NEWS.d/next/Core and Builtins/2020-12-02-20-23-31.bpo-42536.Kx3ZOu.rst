Several built-in and standard library types now ensure that their internal
result tuples are always tracked by the :term:`garbage collector
<garbage collection>`:

- :meth:`collections.OrderedDict.items() <collections.OrderedDict>`

- :meth:`dict.items`

- :func:`enumerate`

- :func:`functools.reduce`

- :func:`itertools.combinations`

- :func:`itertools.combinations_with_replacement`

- :func:`itertools.permutations`

- :func:`itertools.product`

- :func:`itertools.zip_longest`

- :func:`zip`

Previously, they could have become untracked by a prior garbage collection.
