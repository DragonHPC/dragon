# Dragon Examples

This directory contains example code using the Dragon APIs.  The purpose of examples here is to show how the
Dragon APIs can be used directly to accomplish a variety of tasks including shared memory access, process
control, and communication.  These examples are in some cases motivated by multiprocessing and give an idea of
how its interfaces are implemented over Dragon.

There are READMEs in all directories with more details on the available examples.

* `dragon_gs_client`: examples using the Dragon GS Client API directly
* `dragon_native`: examples using Dragons native objects
* `multiprocessing`: examples using Python Multiprocessing with the Dragon runtime.
* `dragon_data`: examples using Dragon Dictionary object

Refer to the API reference in the documentation for further information on the Dragon API stack.
