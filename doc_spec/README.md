Home of Architecture Documentation
===================================

This is the enventual home of a completely separate document from our API and
Project documentation. It is separated because it may have similar function
definitions to code that is actually implemented and we can't have duplicate
definitions within the document since Sphinx will complain.

This documentation provides the specification/architecture requirements that may
not be currently implemented. It may at some point provide overlapping
documentation to our actual implementation/API docs.
