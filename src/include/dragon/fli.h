/**
 * @brief Create an FLI adapter.
 *
 * An FLI adapter guarantees that a send and receive handle
 * is between one sender and one receiver and will not have to deal with data
 * interleaving from other processes. In addition, data may be streamed between
 * the sender and receiver when the FLI adapter is not used in buffered mode.
 * FLI adapters may be created in one of several modes.
 *
 * When the main channel is provided the FLI adapter will be use in one of
 * three modes.
 *
 * 1. In buffered mode the main channel is used to communicate on a many
 * to many style connection where each send conversation is a complete conversation
 * between a sender and a receiver. In this mode, if multiple sends are done, they
 * are buffered before sending. In buffered mode receivers will receive the sent
 * message as one receive operation, even if multiple sends were performed.
 *
 * 2. In non-buffered mode the main channel is a channel of stream channels and the
 * API manages allocating a stream channel to an open send handle and providing that
 * stream channel to a receiver by placing its serialized descriptor into the main
 * channel to be picked up by opening a receive handle. In this case the main channel
 * is used to manage 1:1 conversations between an open send handle and an open receive handle.
 *
 * When using this mode, the stream channels come from one of two location. Either
 * there is a manager channel which manages a set of stream channels to be used when
 * sending data, OR a sender may provide a stream channel when opening the send handle.
 *
 * 3. There is one special case when a main channel is used in non-buffered mode
 * and it is known that there is a single sender and single receiver using the FLI
 * adapter. In this case, both the sender and receiver must specify a special
 * constant of STREAM_CHANNEL_IS_MAIN_FOR_1_1_CONNECTION for the stream channel
 * argument when opening the send handle and when opening the receive handle.
 *
 * If the mgr_ch is not NULL, then it is used in one of a couple different
 * ways. Please note: When creating an FLI adapter using the buffered protocol
 * no manager channel should be specified.
 *
 * 1. When created in non-buffered mode, the manager channel contains a set
 * of serialized descriptors for stream channels that will be provided
 * to send handles when they are opened. If no main channel exists, then
 * the stream channel must be provided when the receiver opens a receive
 * handle. If stream channels are provided when the receive handle is opened
 * then no main channel is required.
 *
 * 2. When the fli adapter is created, the user may provide a main channel,
 * a manager channel, and a set of stream channels. In this case, the fli
 * adapter will maintain the stream channels and dole them out and re-use them
 * as send and receive handles are opened and closed, always guaranteeing that
 * any conversation between sender and receiver is will not be interleaved with
 * data from other processes.
 *
 * If desired, a stream channel can be provided on either send handle open or
 * receive handle open operations. In that way, the stream channel can be
 * allocated by either the sender or receiver, but not both. When a stream
 * channel is provided on a send or receive open operation your application
 * must decide whether the senders or receivers will be supplying the stream
 * channels. When stream channels are provided on send handle open operations,
 * a manager channel is not necessary. When stream channels are provided on
 * receive handle open operations, a main channel is not necessary.
 *
 * Sharing FLI adapters is possible either by serializing and attaching to the
 * adapter or by re-creating it from its constituent parts. NOTE: When
 * re-creating an adapter by calling this function, the strm_channels should
 * only be provided on the initial call to create. Providing them a second
 * time will result in the channels being added more than once into the
 * adapter which could lead to unpredictable results.
 *
 * @param adapter is a descriptor and opaque handle to the FLI adapter and is
 * initialized by this call.
 *
 * @param main_ch is a channel descriptor for the main channel of this FLI
 * adapter. It is used internally in the adapter. After the life of the
 * adapter it is up to user code to clean up this channel.
 *
 * @param mgr_ch is a channel used internally by the FLI adapter and not to be
 * touched by user code during the life of the adapter. After the life of the
 * adapter it is up to user code to clean up this channel. Supplying a NULL
 * mgr_ch argument indicates this is either a buffered FLI adapter and must be
 * accompanied by a value of 0 for the num_fli_chs argument or a stream channel
 * will be supplied on all send operations.
 *
 * @param pool is a pool to use for internal allocations necessary for the
 * operation of the pool. If pool is NULL, then the pool of the
 * main_ch channel will be used for required adapter allocations. If the main
 * channel is not local, the default local pool will be used.
 *
 * @param num_strm_chs is the number of supplied stream channels that are provided
 * on the creation of the FLI adapter. Each stream channel may be re-used and
 * is used for one stream of messages that result from an open, multiple sends, and a
 * close operation.
 *
 * @param strm_channels is an array of channel descriptors, num_strm_chs of them, that
 * are being supplied on the adapter creation. See the longer discussion in the description
 * of the adapter create above. The application is responsible for the clean up of these
 * channels at the end of their life.
 *
* @param use_buffered_protocol if true then only a main channel should be provided and no
 * manager channel or stream channels are required. In this case all sent data is
 * buffered into one message for all file write operations (all writes on an open send
 * handle). The receiving side receives one message per conversation.
 *
 * @param attr is a pointer to the attributes structure that was previously
 * inited. If the attr arg is NULL the default attributes will be used.
 *
 * @return DRAGON_SUCCESS or a return code to indicate what problem occurred.

/**
 * @brief Receive data from the FLI adapter.
 *
 * All receive operations between an open and a close of a recv handle are
 * guaranteed to be received by one receiver in the order they were sent. If
 * the return code comes comes back with DRAGON_EOT, then there is no more
 * data to be received. When DRAGON_EOT is returned there may be valid data
 * with it. The num_bytes will always indicate the amount of valid data returned.
 *
 * @param recv_handle is an open send handle.
 *
 * @param requested_size is the maximum number of bytes to receive. There may be
 * less bytes received. num_bytes provides the actual number of bytes read. If
 * requested_size==0 then all available bytes are read.
 *
 * @param received_size is a pointer to a variable that will be initialized with the
 * number of received bytes.
 *
 * @param bytes points to a pointer that will be initialized with the received bytes.
 * The space pointed to by bytes after this call must be freed.
 *
 * @param arg is a pointer to meta-data assigned in a 64-bit unsigned integer by
 * the sender when the data was sent.
 *
 * @param timeout is a pointer to a timeout structure. If NULL, then wait forever
 * with no timeout. If not NULL, then wait for the specified amount of time and
 * return DRAGON_TIMEOUT if not sucessful. If 0,0 is provided, then that indicates
 * that a try-once attempt is to be made.
 *
 * @return DRAGON_SUCCESS, DRAGON_EOT or a return code to indicate what problem
 * occurred. When DRAGON_EOT is returned there may also be bytes that were read
 * or there may be zero bytes read.
