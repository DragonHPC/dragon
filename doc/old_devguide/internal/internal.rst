Internal Documentation (TO BE REVIEWED)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This area documents internal and developmental components and interfaces. They may be part of the open source
or of the proprietary implementation but either way they are not part of the Dragon public API.

If they are involved in any upstreamed code they should be provided not as user documentation but instead as
documentation for maintainers.
